 Client-Server File Sharing Log
==========================

📅 DATE: 10 May 2025
💻 SYSTEM: Windows OS (64-bit)
🧰 TOOLCHAIN: MSYS2 (g++) / MinGW / Windows Terminal

--------------------------
1. Project Directory Setup
--------------------------
✅ Created a folder:
   C:\Users\sjgwa\Desktop\hello

✅ Files placed:
   - server.cpp      ← C++ code for the server
   - client.cpp      ← C++ code for the client
   - testfile.txt    ← File to be shared from server to client

--------------------------
2. Code Implementation
--------------------------
✏️ Wrote the server code in server.cpp:
   - Initializes Winsock.
   - Listens on port 5000.
   - Sends testfile.txt to client.

✏️ Wrote the client code in client.cpp:
   - Connects to server on localhost (127.0.0.1).
   - Receives file data.
   - Saves as received.txt.

--------------------------
3. Compiling the Code
--------------------------
🛠️ Commands used in MSYS2 (UCRT64 shell):

   g++ server.cpp -o server.exe -lws2_32
   g++ client.cpp -o client.exe -lws2_32

✅ Both server.exe and client.exe compiled successfully.

--------------------------
4. Running the Program
--------------------------
🧪 Step 1: Ran server.exe
   Output:
     Server listening on port 5000...

🧪 Step 2: Ran client.exe
   Output:
     File received and saved as 'received.txt'.

✅ File transfer successful.

--------------------------
5. Errors Faced & Fixes
--------------------------
❌ Error: "File not found." on server
   🔧 Fix: testfile.txt was missing or in wrong directory.
   ✅ Solution: Placed testfile.txt in same folder as server.exe.

❌ Error: "This app can't run on your PC."
   🔧 Fix: Recompiled with correct architecture using:
       g++ server.cpp -o server.exe -lws2_32 -m64

❌ Error: "Bind failed."
   🔧 Fix: Port 5000 was already in use or required admin rights.
   ✅ Solution: Killed processes or ran terminal as administrator.

--------------------------
6. Verification
--------------------------
✅ Client received "received.txt".
✅ Contents matched "testfile.txt".
✅ Transfer was complete and error-free.

--------------------------
7. Next Improvements (Optional)
--------------------------
🔁 Add support for filename request.
📁 Allow transfer of any file type (images, PDFs).
🔒 Implement authentication or encryption (SSL/TLS).

--------------------------
🧾 Summary
--------------------------
Client and Server file sharing using Winsock in C++ was implemented successfully. Files were compiled with g++ and executed without runtime issues after addressing path and permission problems.
